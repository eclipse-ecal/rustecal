//! Defines a simple `BinaryPayload` writer for zero-copy benchmarks.
//!
//! This payload writer mirrors the C++ `CBinaryPayload` example:
//! - `write_full` fills the entire buffer with a constant byte (0x2A).
//! - `write_modified` updates a single byte per invocation to simulate changing data.
//! - `get_size` reports the exact buffer size needed.
